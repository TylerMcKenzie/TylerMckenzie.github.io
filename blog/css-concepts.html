        <p>Well so far as I can see, speaking from what little experience that I posess, version control is pretty nifty! It lets you revise your code in a controlled manner. I would have to say that out of any pick, right now, I'd choose GitHub's form of version control. This form makes it really easy to see what files go into what you are making. It even color codes the old code and the new code along with chronologically showing what you changed! That's not the best part! GitHub lets you share your code with other people so you can get their opinions and coding suggestions! It even allows others to change directly what you have been working on! And GitHub, being as cool as it is, allows you to set your project to be run by you! So you are in a sense, THE BOSS! Fangirling aside, GitHub's version control creates this sense of security(the community) and power(the licensing) both of which I love! These are a few reasons why I would choose GitHub to store my code in!</p>

            <h4>  What is the deal with "inline" and "inline-block"? <p class="aside-font">11/28/15</p></h4>
        </div>
        <p>Wait, what? Why even compare the two, they are the same thing right? At first glance it would be easy to assume such things. The truth is that these two displays act similarily but they have a few differences. To start off, let's explain specifically what the two really are. Starting with inline.</p>
        <p>Inline: This display option lets the user display the element they want "inline" with the flow of the page versus being stacked on top of one another.</p>
        <p>So then let's imagine that inline is like using a "span" element (Don't know what this is? Click <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_span.asp">here</a>). Then that span is placed within another "div" (What's this? Click <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_div.asp">here</a>) and given a height of 100px and a red border. It would look something like this:</p>
        <img src="../imgs/blog-inline-image.png">
        <p>As you can see that only the span has the border and not the height. That is because while the element is inline, it cannot have height as it would disrupt the "inline" flow of the div.</p>
        <p>Adversly Inline-block allows the element to have a height. Because it creates a block, but keeps it "inline" with the element. Like so:</p>

            <h4> What are hashes and arrays? <p class="aside-font">12/5/15</p></h4>
        </div>
        
        <p>Hashes and Arrays! No, not hashtags and a ray, hashes and arrays! Like the numbers, right? Of course! Let's begin!</p>
        <p>Strong opening right? Just about as strong as an array's ability to store information. Yup! Arrays are there to store your information! But how does it store this information?</p>
        <p>Indexing! That's how! What you don't know about indexing? 0_0</p>
        <p>Well indexing is when you asign values to each part, or index, in an array. Looks like this: array[1,2,3,4], where array[0] = 1.</p>
        <p>An array's index always starts at 0 so it goes 0,1,2,3...and so on.</p>
        <p>==</p>
        <p>Hashes work in a similar fashion.</p>
        <p>However, instead of using numbers as indexes, Hashes use key values</p>
        <p>Whereas the key value is an object pointing to another object. For instance: Hash.new("A" => "alligator, "B" => "bass"), simple right?</p>

            <h4>WE WANT ARRAYS!<p class="aside-font">12/13/15</p></h4>
        </div>

        <p>WHOA! So demanding! Fine! I'll give you one! What? You want more? Out of just one array? That's weird... So like arrays of 3 from 1 one array? Uhh... I don't know how to do that...</p>
        <p>WAIT!!</p>
        <p>I do.</p>
        <p>EVERYONE CONFUSED?!? Good. I'll explain.</p>
        <p>We can calm the hunger for arrays with a simple enumerable known as <code>.each_slice</code>. This enumerable will take a slice out of any array you want!</p>
        <p>It works like this:</p>
        <p><code>groups =  [nil, nil, nil, nil, nil, nil, nil, nil, nil, nil, nil, nil, nil, nil, nil]</code></p>
        <p><code>groups = array.each_slice(3).to_a # => returns [[nil, nil, nil], [nil, nil, nil], [nil, nil, nil], [nil, nil, nil], [nil, nil, nil]]</code></p>
        <p>Pretty neat eh? We made an array comprised of arrays that are 3 full! Woo! You can make delicious slices of any array that you want!</p>
        <p>You can also do stuff to each slice if you want, like so:</p>
        <p><code>(1..10).each_slice(3) { |a| p a }</code></p>
        <p><code># outputs below</code></p>
        <p><code>[1, 2, 3]</code></p>
        <p><code>[4, 5, 6]</code></p>
        <p><code>[7, 8, 9]</code></p>
        <p><code>[10]</code></p>
        <p>Nice!</p>

            <h4>Takin' Ya Too Class!<p class="aside-font">12/25/15</p></h4>
        </div>

        <p>Ready to get schooled? Bet ya are! Let's begin.</p>
        <p>A class is like a bag that hold all your coding goodies! The way that this works is by using more baggy things known as "methods". They go in the class like baby bags, of code. Cute.</p>
        <p>Still too vague? That's okay. We'll make an expample! Like adding words together. Using methods!</p>
        <p>Let's start with an empty class.</p>
        <p><code>Class Example_Word_Class</code></p>
        <p><code>end</code></p>
        <p>Easy! Now let's make or "define" a method!</p> 
        <p><code>Class Example_Word_Class</code></p>
        <p><code>def first_method_initialize</code></p>
        <p><code></code></p>
        <p><code>end</code></p>
        <p><code>end</code></p>
        <p>Next we will setup a string.</p>
        <p><code>Class Example_Word_Class</code></p>
        <p><code>def first_method_initialize</code></p>
        <p><code>first_string = "Hey!"</code></p>
        <p><code>p first_string # this "puts" the value of the variable to the console so it'd put "Hey!" to the console.</code></p>
        <p><code>end</code></p>
        <p><code>end</code></p>
        <p>Now we wanted to add more to that right? But we wanted to use another method to do it. Then we would define a new method and simply add new information to the words or "String"</p>
        <p><code>Class Example_Word_Class</code></p>
        <p><code>def first_method_initialize</code></p>
        <p><code>first_string = "Hey!"</code></p>
        <p><code>end</code></p>
        <p><code>def second_method_add</code></p>
        <p><code>new_words = "We are new words!"</code></p>
        <p><code>added_string = first_string + new_words</code></p>
        <p><code>p added_string # => "Hey!We are new words!"</code></p>
        <p><code>end</code></p>
        <p><code>end</code></p>
        <p>Oops! This code would actually not work! Even though the variables are within the same class they won't work with each method as the variables are specific to each method that they are in. The way to fix this would be to make the variables to each method. These would then be called "instance variables." They look like this. . .</p>
        <p><code>Class Example_Word_Class</code></p>
        <p><code>def first_method_initialize</code></p>
        <p><code>@first_string = "Hey!"  # adding @ to the variable makes it an instance variable</code></p>
        <p><code>end</code></p>
        <p><code>def second_method_add</code></p>
        <p><code>new_words = "We are new words!"</code></p>
        <p><code>@first_string + new_words</code></p>
        <p><code>end</code></p>
        <p><code>end</code></p>
        <p>Great! We are pretty much done with this code except we haven't run the class yet so nothing gets put out to the console.</p>
        <p>So we'd do the following:</p>
        <p><code>Class Example_Word_Class</code></p>
        <p><code>def first_method_initialize</code></p>
        <p><code>@first_string = "Hey!"</code></p>
        <p><code>end</code></p>
        <p><code>def second_method_add</code></p>
        <p><code>new_words = "We are new words!"</code></p>
        <p><code>@first_string + new_words</code></p>
        <p><code>end</code></p>
        <p><code>end</code></p>
        <p><code>run_our_class = Example_Word_Class.new # => "Hey!"</code></p>
        <p><code>run_our_class.second_method_add # => "Hey!We are new words!"</code></p>
        <p>Cool stuff this coding business eh?</p>
