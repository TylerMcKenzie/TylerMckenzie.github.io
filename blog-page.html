I would have to say that out of any pick, right now, I'd choose GitHub's form of version control. This form makes it really easy to see what files go into what you are making. It even color codes the old code and the new code along with chronologically showing what you changed! That's not the best part! GitHub lets you share your code with other people so you can get their opinions and coding suggestions! It even allows others to change directly what you have been working on! And GitHub, being as cool as it is, allows you to set your project to be run by you! So you are in a sense, THE BOSS! Fangirling aside, GitHub's version control creates this sense of security(the community) and power(the licensing) both of which I love! These are a few reasons why I would choose GitHub to store my code in!</p>
